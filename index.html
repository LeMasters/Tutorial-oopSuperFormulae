	<!-- note that I've divvied code into several
		smaller, more manageable files. 
		In this case, it is overkill, but you
		can easily see why having a color palette
		routine, for example, in an easy-to-copy 
		file can be useful to you in the future.
		
		While other programming languages handle code
		across various files with ease, javaScript
		does not (although apparently the new version
		of ECMAScript(tm) will.)  However, we can
		easily use our HTML index file as a file
		manager.-->
